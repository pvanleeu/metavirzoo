Abstract:  The One Health framework links animal, human, and environmental health, and focuses on emerging zoonotic pathogens. Understanding the interface between wildlife and human activity is critical due to the unpredictable nature of the spillover of zoonotic pathogens from animals to humans. Accredited zoos are important partners in One Health because of their contributions related to education, conservation, and animal health monitoring. In addition, the housing of wildlife in captive and semi-natural settings makes zoos especially relevant for detecting animal-related pathogens. A first step to determine the utility of zoos in contributing to pathogen surveillance is to survey the peer-reviewed literature. We retrieved data from the peer-reviewed literature, and performed a meta-analysis to determine global patterns of viral seroprevalence in mammals housed in zoo collections over the previous 20 years. We found 41 articles, representing a total of 9,219 terrestrial mammals. Increased prevalence in host-specific viruses according to their taxonomy were found, and non-zoonotic viruses exhibited greater seroprevalence than non-zoonotic viruses worldwide. Potentially complex patterns with geography were also identified, despite low sampling in North American zoos. This research highlights the important role zoos can play in public health, and encourages future standardized epidemiological surveillance of zoological collections.
